# DifferentialEvolution
This is a Differential Evolution (DE) program written in Matlab. DE is an optimization routine that creates candidate models according to an evolutionary equation.
It is useful for discontinuous optimization problems where gradient-based methods like Gauss-Newton will fail. The matlab script DEexample.m solves a simple sample
problem based on projectile motion. It creates a projectile curve and then finds its way back to the correct acceleration, initial velocity, and initial height from randon 
starting guesses.
